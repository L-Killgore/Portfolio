                                Below are three web apps I created, the first of which is a React app made using the PERN Stack, and the other two are Django apps that were adapted from assignments from Harvard's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" target="_blank">CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> course, for which I received certification viewable in my About Me section below. If you wish to demo one of the apps, an account can be made on Prediction Tracker, or a separate account can be made on either of the two Django projects. All of my code is viewable on GitHub by clicking the "View Code" buttons next to each project.

                                Users can post their predictions and the reasons for making their predictions, and view the predictions of others. Each Prediction can be voted on as to its plausbility or correctness.

                                This full-stack App was created using React, Node.js, and Express with a PostgreSQL database (PERN Stack). Sequelize is used as the ORM tool, in addition to Axios used for handling API calls. Finally, React's createContext() hook is used to create a Context Provider to handle state globally. Heroku is the service provider that serves the backend of the app, and an AWS S3 Bucket is used to serve the frontend. Bootstrap is used for most of the design.

                            <p class="ti">
                                As COVID-19 began propagating in the US, I was finishing up my final quarter as an adult at UCLA after an academic hiatus. I earned B.A.s in Philosophy and German Language Studies. After graduating, looking desperately for work, navigating a brief foray into the world of Technical Communication, and even working as a Seasonal Driver Helper with UPS over the Christmas Holidays, I decided to pursue Software Engineering. I had had experience writing in HTML/CSS and Python from several years before, so I began teaching myself how to make web apps using Django. However, after some more research into the field, I decided to learn and focus on React, specifically using the PERN Stack. Learning how to use Django and React, in addition to implementing a backend and API, I have a good general background in the aspects of building a full-fledged web application. In addition to programming, I have a considerable background in language, writing, and philosophy, and programming broaches all of these subjects in a uniquely technological and practicable way. Thinking in new ways and learning new ways of expressing ideas is an endlessly exciting prospect, and one which I am enjoying greatly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="ti">
                                Besides these pursuits, I am interested in some other subjects like the amateur study of spiders, birds, and trees. I also have a keen interest in the obscure soundscapes of early 20th century Western music, listening and researching about pieces from this period out of sheer personal captivation. I have learned to play some of this music on the piano, being a classically trained pianist with over 25 years of experience. Naturally, having an interest in language and ideas also involves reading works of literature, whether that means getting lost in the paranoiac labyrinths of Thomas Pynchon, or the apollonian philosophical apparatus of Aristotle. Lastly, I have taken pleasure over the years in sharing the things I have learned by tutoring students in English, German, writing, and reading, both as the resident German tutor at Pasadena City College, and at UCLA or freelance. A less formal peripatetic conversation is also great fun!

                                        My background has been in languages, philosophy, and tutoring, but I have recently dedicated myself to becoming a software engineer, which led me to build apps using Django and React, working towards full stack development. My background gives me a unique perspective on computer programming and problem solving that would positively contribute to any team. <a href="media\Lukas_Killgore_Resume_Packet.pdf" download id="am-l" target="_blank">Download my Resume Packet</a>
